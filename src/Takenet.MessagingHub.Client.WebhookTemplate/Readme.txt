Navigate to https://blip.ai to retrieve your application's Webhook key, and set it appSettings in Web.config.

You just need to add a reference to you library project (using C# SDK) so it can run as a webhook template.

See more information about how to build your application at https://blip.ai/portal/#/docs.
