MessagingHub.Client is a simple client for the [Messaging Hub](https://messaginghub.io/) that uses a fluent interface.

# Introduction

The Messaging Hub Client was designed to make it easy to work with the [Lime protocol](http://limeprotocol.org) client to exchange messages among the applications and services connected through the Messaging Hub.

The client is available in some programming languages with the same semantics, like [C#](https://github.com/takenet/messaginghub-client-csharp) and [Javascript](https://github.com/takenet/messaginghub-client-js).

## Working with the Messaging Hub Client

After reference the Messaging Hub.Client in your code, follow the steps in [Getting Started](http://messaginghub.io/docs/sdks/gettingstarted) in order to use the following operations:
- Send and receive [messages](http://messaginghub.io/docs/sdks/messages)
- Send and receive [notifications](http://messaginghub.io/docs/sdks/notifications)
- Send [commands](http://messaginghub.io/docs/sdks/commands)
