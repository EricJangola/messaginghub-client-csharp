The Messaging Hub Client was designed to make it easy to work with the [Lime protocol](http://limeprotocol.org) client to exchange messages among the applications and services connected through fluent interface.

It is available in some programming languages with the same semantics, like [C#](https://github.com/takenet/messaginghub-client-csharp) and [Javascript](https://github.com/takenet/messaginghub-client-js).

## Access key
You need the application name and access key. To do so, follow these steps:
- Access [Console](http://messaginghub.io/home/console)
- Click [List](http://messaginghub.io/application/list) in `Applications` tab
- Find your application and click the `Details` button
- Get the `Application name` and `Access Key` to use
